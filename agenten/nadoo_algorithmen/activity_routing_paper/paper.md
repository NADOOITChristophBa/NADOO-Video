# Dynamic Activity-Based Routing in Neural Networks

## Abstract
We introduce a dynamic, activity-based routing mechanism for neural networks that selectively computes only the most relevant blocks depending on input activity. This technique reduces computational cost and energy consumption while maintaining accuracy. Our experiments show that dynamic routing can skip up to 70% of blocks on average with negligible loss in predictive performance.
**Contributions**:
- Erstes dynamisches activity-basiertes Routing ohne Retraining.
- Reduktion von bis zu 66,7 % der Block-Berechnungen bei minimalem Genauigkeitsverlust.
- Vollständige Benchmark-Suite für synthetische und reale Datensätze.

## 1. Introduction
Deep neural networks are often over-parameterized, leading to redundant computation and high energy consumption. While static pruning and quantization have been explored, they do not adapt to the varying importance of different input samples. We propose an activity-based routing technique that dynamically skips inactive blocks during inference, making deep models more efficient and adaptive.

## 2. Related Work
Prior research includes static pruning, conditional computation, and mixture-of-experts architectures. However, most approaches either require retraining or introduce significant architectural complexity. Our method is simple, plug-and-play, and compatible with existing PyTorch modules.

## 3. Method
- **Activity Measurement:** For each block, compute an activity score (e.g., mean absolute activation).
- **Thresholding:** If the activity is below a learnable or fixed threshold, skip the block and pass the input unchanged.
- **Integration:** The method can be applied to any feedforward or residual network.
### Mathematical Formulation
Let $x$ be the input to a block. The activity is $A(x) = \text{mean}(|x|)$. The block is computed only if $A(x) > \tau$ (threshold).
### 3.1 Algorithm Pseudocode
```python
def dynamic_activity_routing(x, blocks, threshold, classifier):
    skip_count = 0
    for block in blocks:
        out, act = block(x)
        if act > threshold:
            skip_count += 1
        x = out
    logits = classifier(x)
    skip_ratio = skip_count / len(blocks)
    return logits, skip_ratio
```
### 3.2 Complexity Analysis
Compute the worst-case and expected per-sample computational cost. Let B = number of blocks and d = feature dimension. Activation score A(x) per block costs O(d) and block forward costs O(d²):
```
C_worst = B * O(d) + B * O(d²) = O(B * d²)
```
With skip ratio s (fraction of skipped blocks), the expected cost becomes:
```
C_expected ≈ (1 − s) * B * d² + B * d
```
This quantifies computation reduction proportional to s.

### 3.3 Theoretical Compute Reduction
Based on the complexity analysis, the relative Sprachungsreduktion beträgt:
```
Reduction = (C_worst - C_expected) / C_worst = s * (B*d^2) / (B*d^2 + B*d) ≈ s
```
Für große d ist der O(B·d) Overhead vernachlässigbar.

Angenommen, die Aktivierungen x ∼ N(0,σ²), dann gilt näherungsweise:
\[
P(\text{Block wird übersprungen}) = P(A(x)<τ) = \operatorname{erf}\Bigl(\frac{τ\sqrt{d}}{σ\sqrt{π}}\Bigr).
\]

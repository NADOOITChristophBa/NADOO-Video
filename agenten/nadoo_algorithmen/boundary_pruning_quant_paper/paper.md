## Abstract
We propose a framework to identify critical decision boundaries in model activation space for dynamic pruning and to leverage precomputed multi-precision chunked models for on-the-fly quantization switching. By streaming weight chunks and switching precision at runtime, we achieve adaptive compression and computational savings without retraining.

## 1. Introduction
Large-scale neural networks face trade-offs between performance, memory, and latency. Static pruning and quantization fix these trade-offs at deployment time. We introduce a boundary-aware method that:
1. Computes decision regions in chunk-activation space to guide pruning thresholds.
2. Precomputes multiple quantized versions of each chunked layer.
3. Streams weight chunks and switches precision dynamically across regions.

## 2. Contributions
- **Boundary Estimation:** A procedure to map activation patterns to pruning and quantization thresholds using clustering or decision trees.
- **Model Bank:** Generation of a bank of chunked models at varying bit-widths and densities.
- **Runtime Switching:** A lightweight controller that streams chunks and switches between prequantized representations based on the boundary classifier.

## 4. Method
### 4.1 Activation Boundary Modeling
Collect activation samples from validation data. Fit a classifier (e.g., decision tree or k-means) to partition the activation space into regions with similar pruning/quantization requirements.

### 4.2 Multi-Precision Model Bank
Use a weight-splitting script to produce chunked tensors and quantize each chunk at multiple bit-widths (e.g., 32, 8, 4, 1). Store in `data/bank/<model>/<layer>/chunk_i_q<bit>.npy`.

### 4.3 Dynamic Streaming and Precision Switching
Implement a controller that, given activation features, queries the boundary model and selects for each chunk the appropriate quantized file to stream, swapping precision online without model reload.

### 4.4 Pruning Threshold Application
Within each region, apply region-specific pruning thresholds to further zero out low-importance neurons before computing dot products.

## 5. Experimental Protocol
Described in `protocol.md`.

## 6. Discussion
Discuss trade-offs between boundary model complexity, latency overhead, and compression gains.

## 7. Conclusion
Boundary-aware dynamic pruning with on-the-fly quantization switching unifies conditional computation and mixed-precision inference, enabling highly efficient deployment on resource-constrained devices.

## 8. Future Work
- Joint learning of boundary and quantization policies.
- Hardware accelerator integration.
- Extension to transformer and attention modules.
